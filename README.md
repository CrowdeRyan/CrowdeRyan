  <td> At Furman University, I studied mass communications, but my passion was the campus, closed-circuit TV station, of which I served as Executive director for two years. I learned many lessons about leadership and utilizing a teamâ€™s strengths and weaknesses by try to organize a group of college who all would rather be sleeping off last nightâ€™s festivities than finishing an assignment or sitting in front of a computer.</td>

  <td>In my current course of Boot-camp training, I find a new challenge in learn to code that drives me forward, but the people and interactions are steadying familiarity that serve as my foundation.

  <td>So far my path has taught me [insert list of skills I am expected to learn in this class], but the future is full of unexpected and diverse new challenges. However, there are some things that will always be needed, always be necessary: Fulfilling the roles of the individual in order for the whole group to succeed: I have been the lead: making the calls and directing the action â€“ I have been the troubleshooter: doing the groundwork and preparing the contingences â€“ I have been the planner: conceptualizing, adapting, and realizing â€“ I have been the backstop: filling-in, putting in the hours, and making sure completion is a functional reality. All require an adaptable, creative mind with strong communication skills and a solid work ethic. </td>
